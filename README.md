# SVEA_Solutions
Solutions for SVEA vehicles at the KTH Smart Mobility Lab


This repository showcases my solutions for the Small-Vehicles-for-Autonomy (SVEA) platform developed as a Reserach Engineer at the KTH Smart Mobility Lab (SML).


All solutions are developed to run on the Robot Operating System (ROS) in Linux environments and are targeted specifically at the SVEA vehicles. Care has been taken during development to ensure both the ability to scale these solutions onto the entire SVEA fleet, as well as the ability implement these on the Remote Concept Vehicle (RCV) once they have been proven. Solutions are developed as Python/C++ ROS nodes and and run in conjuction with/parallel to existing SML and open source Python/C++ nodes.


The SML svea_starter ROS package is a private repository reserved for SML staff, so I cannot share the full framework that these solutions are integrated into. 


Currently all work is in-development in our (the SML's) svea_starter ROS package
